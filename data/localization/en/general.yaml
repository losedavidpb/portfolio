  introduction:
    title: Hello world! 👋

      <p>
        My name is David, and I have always been passionate about programming. I completed my Computer
        Engineering degree at the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria in 2022, and in 2025 I went
        on to finish my Master’s degree at the University of Limerick.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, I have gained knowledge and experience in developing software products using
        programming languages such as Java, C++, C#, JavaScript and Python. The projects I have worked
        on adhere to Clean Code principles and utilise architectural models such as MVC and design
        patterns such as Command and Observer.
      </p>
