  introduction:
    title: Hello world! 👋
    content: |
      <p>
        My name is David, and one of my great passions is programming. Last year 2022 I completed my Computer
        Engineering Degree at the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, and now I am starting my Master's
        studies at the University of Limerick.
      </p>
      <p>
        During these years, I have acquired knowledge and experience in the development of software
        products with programming languages such as Java, C++, C#, JavaScript, or Python. The projects
        I have worked on follow Clean Code principles, and apply architectural models such as MVC, and
        design patterns such as Command, Singleton, or Abstract Factory.
      </p>
